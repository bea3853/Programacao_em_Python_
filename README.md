# Python Programming Course Repository

Welcome to the **Python Programming Course Repository**! This repository is designed for learners who want to master Python programming from the very basics to more advanced concepts. It covers everything from logic, functions, and data structures to libraries and tools used in Python development.

This course is divided into **20 lessons**, each one focused on specific concepts and topics, with hands-on examples and exercises to help you build practical skills.

## Course Structure

### **1. Python Basics**

* **Lesson 1: Fundamentals of Computing**
  An introduction to the basic principles of computing, the relationship between hardware and software, and how programming fits into the bigger picture.

* **Lesson 2: Logic**
  Understanding logical operators, flow control, and Boolean expressions, which form the foundation of decision-making in programming.

* **Lesson 3: Programming Languages**
  Learn about different types of programming languages, with a focus on Python, its history, and its advantages.

* **Lesson 4: Logical Operators**
  Introduction to logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) and their usage in conditional statements.

* **Lesson 5: Functions for Input and Output**
  Learn how to work with `input()` and `output()` functions to take user input and display data.

### **2. Python Core Concepts**

* **Lesson 6: Indentation | Refactoring | Concatenation**
  Understanding the importance of indentation in Python, how to refactor code for better readability, and string concatenation.

* **Lesson 7: Lists | Tuples | Sets | Dictionaries**
  An introduction to Python's built-in data structures and their operations (lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries).

* **Lesson 8: Conditionals**
  Learn how to use conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions.

* **Lesson 9: Match Case**
  Introduction to the `match` statement in Python 3.10 and beyond, offering an alternative to traditional `if-elif` chains.

* **Lesson 10: Loops**
  Explore `for` and `while` loops for repeating actions and iterating through sequences.

---

### **3. Error Handling and Functions**

* **Lesson 11: Try and Except**
  Learn how to handle exceptions in Python using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks, ensuring robust programs.

* **Lesson 12: Functions**
  Understand how to define and use functions to structure your code into reusable blocks, improve readability, and minimize redundancy.

* **Lesson 13: Code Blocks**
  Understanding how code blocks work in Python and how to structure them logically.

---

### **4. Advanced Python Concepts**

* **Lesson 14: Directory Manipulation**
  Learn how to interact with directories and files using Python, such as creating, deleting, and navigating through them.

* **Lesson 15: Pygame 1**
  Introduction to **Pygame**, the library used for creating video games in Python. Start building simple games by working with graphics, sounds, and events.

* **Lesson 16: Pygame 2**
  Continuing from the previous lesson, dive deeper into **Pygame** by adding more interactive elements and improving the game mechanics.

* **Lesson 17: Testing**
  Understand the importance of writing tests for your code and how to use Python's built-in testing framework (`unittest`).

---

### **5. Software Development and Databases**

* **Lesson 18: Software Development Process**
  Learn about the software development life cycle, from planning and design to coding, testing, and deployment.

* **Lesson 19: Databases | Tkinter Interface**
  Introduction to working with databases in Python and creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with **Tkinter** to interact with the database.

* **Lesson 20: Final Project**
  A comprehensive project where you apply the skills you’ve learned throughout the course, integrating everything into a complete solution.
